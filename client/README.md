# client

> IT354 Game Closet

Open a command prompt/terminal window in the client folder and use the command npm start to run the webpack development server. This will not only provide the website at localhost:8080, but will automatically rebundle files when changes are detected (which allows for easier updating/debugging of the client side code)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
